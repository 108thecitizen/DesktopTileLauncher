## Usage

On Windows, selecting Google Chrome for a tile (or leaving the browser as
Default when Chrome is the system default) reveals a **Chrome profile**
dropdown. The list is populated from Chrome's local profile cache and includes
entries like `Default`, `Profile 1`, or names from signed-in Google accounts.
Choosing a profile pins the tile to that persona; select **None** to use
Chrome's last-used profile.
